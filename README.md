# lv-architecture
This is a a collection of LabVIEW architectures and design patterns I've authored and used a handful of times.

## config (lv-architecture-config)

lv-architecture-config combines some common design patterns I use for storing configuration and accessing it within a LabVIEW application.

For more information, check out [README.md](./config/README.md)

## interface (lv-architecture-interface)

lv-architecture-interface shows some basic patterns for a non re-entrant and re-entrant interface designed for high concurrency.

For more information, check out [README.md](./interface/README.md)

## interface-dom-sub (lv-architecture-interface-dom-sub)

lv-architecture-interface-dom-sub attempts to show a specific use case where a main interface is **dom**inate for multiple **sub**interfaces using subpanels.

For more information, check out [README.md](./interface-dom-sub/README.md)

## launcher (lv-architecture-launcher)

lv-architecture-launcher shows a way to combine one or more interfaces and functional components into a complete application. 

For more information, check out [README.md](./launcher/README.md)
